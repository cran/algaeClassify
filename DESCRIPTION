Description: Functions designed to facilitate the assignment of morpho-functional group (MFG)
    classifications to phytoplankton species based on a combination of taxonomy (Class,Order) and
    a suite of 7 binomial functional traits. Classifications can also be made using only a
    species list and a database of trait-derived classifications included in the package.
    MFG classifications are derived from Salmaso et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/fwb.12520> and
    this reference should be cited when using the package. The 'algaeClassify' package is a product
    of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure
    of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of
    Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center, with data and other support provided by
    members of GLEON (Global Lake Ecology Observation Network). This software is preliminary
