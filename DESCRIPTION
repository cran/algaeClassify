Description: Verify accepted taxonomic nomenclature of phytoplankton species, assign 
	species to functional group classifications, and manipulate taxonomic and functional diversity 
	data. Possible functional classifications include Morpho-functional group (MFG; 
	Salmaso et al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/fwb.12520>) and CSR (Reynolds 1988; Functional morphology and 
	the adaptive strategies of phytoplankton. In C.D. Sandgren (ed). Growth and reproductive 
	strategies of freshwater phytoplankton, 388-433. Cambridge University Press, New York). 
	Version 1.2.0 also includes functions to query names using the algaebase online taxonomic 
	database (<https://www.algaebase.org>; <doi:10.7872/crya.v35.iss2.2014.105>).
	The algaeClassify package is a product of the GEISHA (Global Evaluation of the Impacts of 
	Storms on freshwater Habitat and Structure of phytoplankton Assemblages), funded by CESAB 
    (Centre for Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity) and the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for
	Synthesis and Analysis, with data and other support provided by members of GLEON 
	(Global Lake Ecology Observation Network). This software is preliminary or provisional and
	is subject to revision. It is being provided to meet the need for timely best science. 
	The software has not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 
	No warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS or the U.S. Government as to the 
	functionality of the software and related material nor shall the fact of release constitute 
	any such warranty. The software is provided on the condition that neither the USGS nor the U.S.
