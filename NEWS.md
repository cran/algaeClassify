# algaeClassify 0.1.0

##News

*	This version contains two functions: traits_to_mfg() and traits_to_mfg_df(). These functions
	allow for conversion between functional traits and morpho-functional groups (MFG). Future
	versions will include functions for MFG assignment to species lists, and interconversion 
	between MFG and the CSR classification system.
