\title{Assign phytoplankton species to CSR functional groups, based on surface to volume ratio and
maximum linear dimension ranges proposed by Reynolds et al. 1988;2006}
\usage{
traits_to_csr(
  sav,
  msv,
  msv.source = "Reynolds 2006",
  traitrange = algaeClassify::traitranges
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sav}{numeric estimate of cell or colony surface area /volume ratio}

\item{msv}{numeric product of surface area/volume ratio and maximum linear dimension}

\item{msv.source}{character string with reference source for distinguishing criteria}

\item{traitrange}{data frame with trait criteria for c,s,r groups. The included table
can be replaced with user-defined criteria if desired. Measurements are:
Surface area/volume ratio (sav), maximum linear dimension (mld) and mld*sav (msv).}
}
\value{
a character string with one of 5 return values: C,CR,S,R, or SR.
        CR and SR groups reflect overlap between criteria for the 3 main groups.
